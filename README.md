## What does this do?
This is a firefox focused extension that supports hash encryption of (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-348, SHA-512) of both text and files. I am currently in the process of uploading this as an installation with Mozilla. 

## Why did I create this? 
I created this application to make hashing text and files easier to deal with. For me personally, when I download .ISO files I like to verify their hash and ensure that what I am downloading is what I asked for (I.E. Prevent Man in the middle Attack). I also attempted to replicate
a style similar to HashCalc (the og). 

## How can I install this in 5 minutes?
Steps:
1: Clone this repo

2: In a firefox browser enter: about:debugging

3.) Follow any setup then ensure you are on the This Firefox page.

4.) Click on load Temporary add on

5.) A popup window asking you to select a file. Select the file: hashbox.js

6.) It should now be loaded. YAY!

## Reccomendations
1.) Add a trigger for certain file type downloads?
2.) More Hashes?
